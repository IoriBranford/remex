About Remex
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remex is a set of tools which facilitate the use of RPG Maker-compatible
autotiles outside RPG Maker, in your own game engine. Remex works with 
the automapping feature from Tiled map editor too (http://mapeditor.org).

It features:

* An autotile expander. It turns the compact autotiles from RPG Maker 
  into readily-usable grids of 48 tiles with all the possible 
  tile configurations.
* A script which generates a Tileset for Tiled using an expanded autotile.
* A script which generates an automapping rule for Tiled using the expanded
  the corresponding tileset. It enables you to use the automapping feature of
  Tiled without having to setup anything.

Note #1: Remex works only with autotiles made for RPG Maker VX and VX Ace.
