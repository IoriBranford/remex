1 About Remex
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remex is a set of tools which facilitate the use of RPG Maker-compatible
autotiles outside RPG Maker, in your own game engine. Remex works with 
the automapping feature from Tiled map editor too (http://mapeditor.org).

It features:

* An autotile expander. It turns the compact autotiles from RPG Maker 
  into readily-usable grids of 48 tiles with all the possible 
  tile configurations.
* A script which generates a Tileset for Tiled using an expanded autotile.
* A script which generates an automapping rule for Tiled using the expanded
  the corresponding tileset. It enables you to use the automapping feature of
  Tiled without having to setup anything.

Note #1: Remex works only with autotiles made for RPG Maker 2000 and 2003.

3 General instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remex can be used either through the command-line, either through a GUI. The
command-line version features a few more advanced options. It may be useful if
you want to include Remex in your own scripts too.

To use the GUI, launch gui.exe. To use the command-line version, launch 
main.exe in a terminal.

Please refer to the following sections for more detailed instructions:
1. Instructions for the GUI
2. Instructions for the command-line
3. Instructions for the integration usage in Tiled


4 Instructions for the GUI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the main menu, you can choose between the autotile expander, the tileset
generator and the rule maker. 

###Autotile expander
1. Choose an autotile to expand. It must be a PNG image, 48x64 wide. It must use RPG Maker 2000 or 2003's autotile formatting.
2. Expand your tileset with "Expand the tileset!".
3. Save your tileset with "Save as".

###Tileset generator
1. Choose an expanded autotile to make a tileset with. It must be a PNG image, 128x96 wide. You can expand an autotile from RPG Maker 200x with this software (Main menu > Expand an autotile).
2. Make your tileset with "Make your tileset!"
3. Save your tileset with "Save as".

###Rule maker
1. Choose a Tileset for Tiled to make an automapping rule with.It must be a 
   .tsx file referring to an expanded autotile. You can make a tileset with 
   Remex (Main menu > Generate a tileset).
2. Choose the map layer which will be considered by Tiled during the 
   automapping. By default, its "Tile Layer 1". You can only choose a layer 
   per rule, so you need to make another rule if you want another layer 
   to be considered too.
3. Make sure that the correct version of Tiled is chosen. Remex can make
   tilesets for both Tiled 0.9 and 0.8.
4. Make an automapping rule by with "Make an automapping rule!". It may take
   a few seconds.
5. Save your rule with "Save as". Please note that the code which is shown
   is not the final code, so you shouldn't copy it. 
   Note: The rule maker will an image named "automappingRegions.png" in the
   folder in which you saved the rule. Both work together.

      of an expanded autotile. It enables you to map autotiles automatically, without
      worrying about the precise case to use.

###Expand command
* usage: main.exe expand [-h] [-o outputAutotile] [-f] [-v] inputAutotile

* positional arguments:

   * inputAutotile        
     The autotile to expand. It must follow a few rules. It must be a PNG image, 48x64 wide. It must use RPG Maker 2000 or 2003's autotile formatting.

    * -o outputAutotile, --output outputAutotile

       The output file (the expanded autotile). By default, it is "expandedAutotile.png",
       located in the directoryin which you launch the script. The script will ask you 
       whether it should overwrite the file if it already exists, unless you used 
       the force option.

    * -f, --force

      Forces the script to be executed without asking you anything. The script will 
      overwrite the output file without warning you if it already exists. Furthermore,
      it won't ask add an extension to the output file if it lacks.

    * -v, --verbose

      Starts the program in verbose mode: it prints detailed information on the process.

###Maketileset command
* usage: main.exe maketileset [-h][-o outputTileset] 
  [-f] [-r] [-v] inputExpandedAutotile

* positional arguments:

    * inputExpandedAutotile
       â€‹                  
       The expanded autotile to make a tileset with. It must be a PNG image, 128x96 wide. To get this expanded autotile, use the autotile expander featured with Remex (with the command "expand").

* optional arguments:

    * -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    * -o outputTileset, --output outputTileset

       The output file (the tileset). By default, it is "expandedAutotileTileset.tsx", located in the directory in which you launch the script. The scriptwill ask you whether it should overwrite the file if it already exists, unless you used 
       the force option.

   * -r, --relative

       In the tileset file, use a relative path to the image itself. Warning: the same
       relative path will be used in the rulemap if you generate one with this tileset.
       To avoid any problem regarding paths, you should put your tilesets,
       maps and images in the same folder.

   * -v, --verbose

      Starts the program in verbose mode: it prints detailed information on the process.

6 Instructions for the integration in Tiled
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using automapping in Tiled is very easy with Remex:

1. Grab an autotile from RPG Maker 200x and expand it with Remex.
2. With Remex, make a tileset from this expanded autotile.
3. Still with Remex, make an automapping rule with this tileset.
4. In the same folder, create a file named "rules.txt". Open it and write the
   name of your tileset (for instance "automappingRule.tmx"). Save it and
   close it.
5. In Tiled, create a new map (save it in the same folder as well). 
6. Click on the menu Map > Add an external tileset. Choose the tileset that
   you have created from an expanded autotile.
7. Start mapping! Add any other tileset that you need. When you use the tileset
   created with Remex, you don't have to choose the tile with the correct 
   shape: just design your map with a single tile. For instance, if you've 
   expanded a grass autotile, design the fields without worrying about the
   corners, the borders, etc. You can draw some big green blocks.
8. When you are done and want the autotiles to shape properly, press A (or click
   on Map > AutoMap). 
9. ???
10. Profit!
